# ActiveLearningVSPassiveLearning

Labeling the training data for a machine learning algorithm is a tedious and time-consuming, error-prone process. Furthermore, in some application domains, labeling each example can also be extremely costly financially. The active learning technique helps to deal with this problem by detecting and asking the user to label only the most informative examples in the domain, being a tool that contributes to the data team in the labeling process. Considering the power of smart sampling, this work presents a comparison of classifiers trained with the technique of active learning and passive learning. The results achieved reinforce the superiority and gain that active learning employs in a scenario where data annotation is a critical factor.

**The article highlighted with the title ACTIVE LEARNING A SMART APPROACH TO DATA SAMPLING, highlights the process used to compare active and passive learning.**

**The commented code for implementing the algorithms is available in the Code folder.**

**The Data folder contains the csv file with generated synthetic dataset (the generation code is also inserted in the Code folder file).**
